title: Docker Series - Part I is Out!
---

I've begun a series of posts about Docker, the containerization solution that has all the hype right now.  
It's designed from the ground up so that it is accessible for everyone. This post talks about the theory behind Docker and Linux containers in order to have a mental model of what is happening under the hood. Then we will gradually talk and build more and more complex systems in order to tap the full potential of Docker.
