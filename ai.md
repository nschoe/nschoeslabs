title: Artificial Intelligence
---

I am basically in love with Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning, (Deep) Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, etc).

Here are some very good references:

- [Artificial Intelligence, a Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/), a very good book about a lot of methods and algorithms, written by **[Stuart Russell](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~russell/)** and **[Peter Norvig](http://www.norvig.com/)**
- [An introduction course about Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml) by [Andrew Ng](https://twitter.com/AndrewYNg).
- The [Reddit Artificial Subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/artificial) contains interesting links.

I am currently reading and taking notes about the first book, and I will try to regularly post implementations (in Haskell) of some algorithms described in the book. I will try to update them regularly.
