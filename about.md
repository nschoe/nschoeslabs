title: About Me
---

My name is Nicolas SCHOEMAEKER.  
I (currently) live in France.  
This year, I am going to get a dual degree as an engineer in **Analog Electronics Integrated Design** with **Radio Frequency** major and a Master in Company Administration.

I used to design websites and now shifted my focus onto [Haskell](/haskell.html) and [Artificial Intelligence](/ai.html).  
I play Squash regularly and have played Baskell-Ball for 11 years.

You can read my CV [here](/cv.pdf).

I go generally by the nickname "nschoe" on the Web.  
You can take a look at my [Github](https://github.com/nschoe).  
You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ns_schoe).

I used [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) to power this website.
